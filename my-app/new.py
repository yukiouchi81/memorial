First create a new python file "credentials.py" and write these two lines in that file:
    username = ""salvatm@plattsburgh.edu"
    password = "Salvatore1"
    
And save it in the same folder as this main python code.
Now in this main code file do:

import credentials
And make changes to payload dictionary as shown below. 
payload = {
